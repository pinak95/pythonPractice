## Introduction

Python Practice from Zero is a personal repository where I will document my progress, challenges, and achievements while learning Python. This repository serves as a learning log, allowing me to keep track of the concepts I've covered and the projects I've worked on.

## Getting Started

To get started with Python Practice from Zero, make sure you have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-practice.git
```

Feel free to explore the code, projects, and notes to follow my Python learning journey.

## Topics Covered

In this repository, I will cover a wide range of Python topics, including but not limited to:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, etc.)
- Libraries and Modules (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

## Projects

Throughout my learning journey, I will work on various Python projects, applying the concepts I've learned. The projects will range from simple exercises to more complex applications, each aimed at solidifying my understanding of Python programming.

## Resources

In the "Resources" section, I will keep a list of helpful Python tutorials, articles, and books that have contributed to my learning. Feel free to check them out if you are also interested in learning Python.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as my personal learning log, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community. If you spot any errors, have ideas for improvement, or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
